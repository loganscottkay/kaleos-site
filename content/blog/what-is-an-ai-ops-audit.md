Most businesses know they should be using AI for something. The problem is figuring out what.

Should you automate your invoicing? Your client onboarding? Your sales follow-ups? All of it? None of it?

That's what an AI Ops Audit answers.

## What it actually is

An AI Ops Audit is a structured review of your business operations. We look at how your team spends their time, identify the workflows that are repetitive and pattern-based, and map out exactly where AI automation would save you the most time and money.

It's not a sales pitch disguised as a consultation. It's an honest assessment. If automation doesn't make sense for a particular workflow, we'll tell you that too.

## What the process looks like

It starts with a short intake form where you tell us about your business, your team, and the tasks that feel like they take too long. Then we schedule a call to dig deeper.

During that call, we walk through your day-to-day operations. Not at a high level. We get specific. What tools do you use? What does the actual workflow look like step by step? Where do things get stuck?

After the call, we do the analysis. We look at each workflow through the lens of what's automatable today, not what might be possible in two years. Practical, proven approaches only.

## What you get at the end

You get a clear, written report that covers:

- **Your top automation opportunities**, ranked by time saved and ease of implementation
- **Estimated hours saved per week** for each opportunity
- **A recommended starting point**, so you know exactly what to build first
- **Rough cost estimates** for implementation, so there are no surprises
- **What to leave alone**, because not everything should be automated

The report is yours to keep whether you work with us or not. It's a roadmap you can hand to any team or vendor.

## Why it matters

Without an audit, most businesses either do nothing (because it feels overwhelming) or jump straight into building something that doesn't actually move the needle.

The audit removes the guesswork. You'll know exactly what to automate, in what order, and what kind of return to expect. That clarity is worth more than any tool.

## What it costs

Our founding rate for the AI Ops Audit is $750 (normally $1,500). That includes the full review, the call, and the written report.

If the audit shows that automation could save your team 10+ hours a week, the math speaks for itself.
