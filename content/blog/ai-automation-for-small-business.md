You've heard the noise. AI this, automation that. Every LinkedIn post makes it sound like you need a six-figure budget and a team of engineers to get started.

You don't.

If you're running a business with 10 to 50 people, you're actually in the best position to benefit from AI automation. You're small enough to move fast and big enough that repetitive work is already eating into your margins.

Here's where to start.

## 1. Email follow-ups

Think about how much time your team spends sending follow-up emails. A proposal goes out, then someone has to remember to check back in three days. A client goes quiet, and someone has to write a nudge. A lead fills out a form, and someone has to send the intro email.

All of that can be automated. Not with some generic template blast. With actual personalized messages drafted in your voice, sent on your schedule, triggered by real events. Your team reviews and approves before anything goes out. But the drafting, scheduling, and tracking? That's handled.

Most businesses save 5 to 10 hours a week just on this one.

## 2. Scheduling and coordination

How many back-and-forth emails does it take to book a meeting at your company? How often do things slip through the cracks because nobody followed up on a calendar invite?

AI can handle the coordination. It looks at availability, sends the invite, follows up if someone hasn't responded, and reschedules when things change. No more "does Tuesday work?" chains. No more missed appointments because the reminder didn't go out.

This one's simple but the time savings add up fast.

## 3. Reporting and data entry

If someone on your team is spending hours pulling numbers from one tool, formatting them in a spreadsheet, and emailing a summary to the team, that's a perfect automation candidate.

AI can pull data from your existing tools, compile it into the format you actually use, and deliver it on a schedule. Weekly sales reports, monthly client summaries, project status updates. Whatever you're currently building by hand.

The first time your Monday morning report shows up in your inbox without anyone touching it, you'll wonder why you didn't do this sooner.

## You don't need to automate everything

The mistake most businesses make is trying to do too much at once. Pick one workflow. Automate it. See the results. Then move to the next one.

Start with whatever's eating the most time. That's usually where the biggest return is.
